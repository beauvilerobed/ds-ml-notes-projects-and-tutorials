    "# A/B Testing: Conversion Rate Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll go through the process of analyzing an A/B experiment: from formulating a hypothesis, testing it, to interpreting the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** Imagine you work on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer has created a new product page design with the hope of increasing the conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is around 13% on average throughout the year. The team considers the new design a success if it increases the conversion rate to 15% (a 2% increase).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before rolling out the change to all users, the team wants to test it on a small subset. You suggest running an A/B test on this subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing Our Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formulating a Hypothesis\n",
    "Since we do not know if the new design will perform better, worse, or the same as the current design, we will choose a **two-tailed test**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0: p = p_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_1: p \\neq p_0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We set a **confidence level** of 95%:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\alpha = 0.05\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\alpha$ value is the threshold we use to determine significance: if the probability of observing a result as extreme or more (the p-value) is lower than $\\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing the Variables\n",
    "We need two groups for the test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Group:** Shown the old design.\n",
    "- **Treatment (Experimental) Group:** Shown the new design.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **independent variable** is the design version (old vs. new). We include two groups to control for external factors like seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dependent variable** is the conversion rate, which can be coded per user session as a binary variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 0 — User did not purchase during the session.\n",
    "- 1 — User purchased during the session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choosing a Sample Size\n",
    "Since we will not test the entire user base, the observed conversion rates are estimates of the true population rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Larger sample sizes** → more precise estimates (smaller confidence intervals) → higher likelihood of detecting a difference if one exists.\n",
    "- **Smaller sample sizes** → cheaper and easier to implement but less precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size is estimated using **Power Analysis**, which depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power of the test ($1 - \\beta$):** Probability of detecting a true difference if one exists (commonly set to 0.8).  \n",
    "- **Alpha ($\\alpha$):** Significance level (set at 0.05).  \n",
    "- **Effect size:** Expected difference between conversion rates (here, 2%, from 13% to 15%).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use these values to calculate the minimum number of users needed in each group to detect a significant effect."
