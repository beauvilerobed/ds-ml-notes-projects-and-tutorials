The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.\n",
