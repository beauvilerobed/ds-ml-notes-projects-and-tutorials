    "## 1. Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are the bedrock of causal inference, providing rigorous evidence of causality. They involve randomly assigning participants to **treatment** and **control** groups, ensuring that any observed differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formal Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_i(1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "denote the potential outcome for unit $ i $ if treated, and\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_i(0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "if untreated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Average Treatment Effect (ATE)** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ATE = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because randomization ensures independence between treatment assignment $ D_i $ and potential outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D_i \\perp (Y_i(0), Y_i(1))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can estimate the causal effect unbiasedly as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_i | D_i = 0]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gold standard for causal inference due to random assignment.\n",
    "* Provides high internal validity, helping establish strong causality.\n",
    "* Results can be generalized to a larger population under certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* May be expensive, time-consuming, or ethically challenging.\n",
    "* Not always feasible for all research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-life Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pharmaceutical trials:** Used to assess the efficacy of new drugs by comparing treated and placebo groups.\n",
    "* **Education interventions:** Used to evaluate innovative teaching methods on student performance.\n",

    "### Interview Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q:** How do randomized controlled trials ensure unbiased causal inference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A:** By using random assignment to create comparable treatment and control groups, ensuring that any differences in outcomes can be attributed to the treatment itself."

    "## 2. Matching Methods\n",

    "Matching methods are used when randomization is not feasible. Researchers pair treated and untreated units with similar characteristics to approximate a randomized design.\n",

    "### Mathematical Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ X_i $ denote observed covariates, and $ D_i $ the treatment indicator. Matching ensures:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* Reduces selection bias by balancing covariates between treatment and control groups.\n",
