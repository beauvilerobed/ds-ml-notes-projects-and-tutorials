# Given a list of at least three numbers named sides. 
# Each entry in sides represents the length of a side of a triangle. 
# Write a function possible_triangles to determine the number of possible 
# triangles that can be formed using the given side lengths. 
# In the case that more than three side lengths are given, there may be several 
# possible triangles.

# Note: If there are multiple equal side lengths in the list, we consider them as distinct sides.

# Examples:
# Input: sides = [3, 3, 3] -> 1
#        sides = [3, 3, 3, 3] -> 4
#        sides = [1, 2, 3.5] -> 0
