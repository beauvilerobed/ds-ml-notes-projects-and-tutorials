    "A central problem in machine learning is how to make an algorithm that willperform well not just on the training data, but also on new inputs. Many strategiesused in machine learning are explicitly designed to reduce the test error, possiblyat the expense of increased training error. These strategies are known collectivelyas regularization. \n",
