    "## How Learning Differs from Pure Optimization?\n",
    "\n",
    "In most machine learning scenarios, we care about some performance measure $P$, that is deﬁned with respect to the test set. We therefore optimize $P$ only indirectly. We reduce a diﬀerent cost function $J(\\theta)$ in the hope that doing so will improve $P$. This is in contrast to pure optimization,where minimizing $J$ is a goal in and of itself. Optimization algorithms for training deep models also typically include some specialization on the speciﬁc structure of machine learning objective functions. This function can be written as an average over the training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "J(\\theta) = E_{(x,y)\\sim \\hat{P}_{data}} L(f(x;\\theta), y)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the per-example loss function,$f(x;θ)$ is the predicted output when the input is $x$, and $\\hat{P}_{data}$ the empirical distribution. In the supervised learning case, $y$ is the target output. \n",
    "\n",
    "We would usually prefer to minimize the corresponding objective function where the expectation is taken across the data-generating distribution $P_{data}$ rather than just over the ﬁnite training set:\n",

    "### Empirical Risk Minimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of a machine learning algorithm is to reduce the expected generalization error. This quantity is known as the **risk**. We emphasize here that the expectation is taken over the true underlying distribution $P_{data}$. If we knew the true distribution $P_{data}(x, y)$, risk minimization would be an optimization task solvable by an optimization algorithm. When we do not know $P_{data}(x, y)$ but only have a training set of samples, however, we have a machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to convert a machine learning problem back into an optimization problem is to minimize the expected loss on the training set. This means replacing the true distribution $p(x, y)$ with the empirical distribution $\\hat{P}_{data}(x, y)$ deﬁned by the training set. We now minimize the **empirical risk**\n",

    "where $m$ is the number of training examples. The training process based on minimizing this average training error is known as **empirical risk minimization**. Nonetheless, empirical risk minimization is prone to overﬁtting. Models withhigh capacity can simply memorize the training set. In many cases, empiricalrisk minimization is not really feasible. The most eﬀective modern optimizationalgorithms are based on gradient descent, but many useful loss functions, suchas 0-1 loss, have no useful derivatives (the derivative is either zero or undeﬁnedeverywhere). These two problems mean that, in the context of deep learning, werarely use empirical risk minimization. Instead, we must use a slightly diﬀerentapproach, in which the quantity that we actually optimize is even more diﬀerentfrom the quantity that we truly want to optimize\n",

For example, exactly minimizing expected 0-1loss is typically intractable (exponential in the input dimension). In such situations, one typically optimizes a surrogate loss function instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch and Minibatch Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "One aspect of machine learning algorithms that separates them from generaloptimization algorithms is that the objective function usually decomposes as a sumover the training examples. Optimization algorithms for machine learning typically compute each update to the parameters based on an expected value of the costfunction estimated using only a subset of the terms of the full cost function. For example maximum likelihood estimation problems when viewed in logspace, decompose into a sum over each example:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "Computing this expectation exactly is very expensive because it requiresevaluating the model on every example in the entire dataset.

    "Challenges in Neural Network Optimization include\n",
    "- **Ill-Conditioning**: Ill-conditioning can manifest by causing SGD to get“stuck” in the sense that even very small steps increase the cost function.\n",

    "- **Local Minima**: With nonconvex functions, such as neural nets, it is possible to have manylocal minima. Indeed, nearly any deep model is essentially guaranteed to havean extremely large number of local minima.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Plateaus, Saddle Points and Other Flat Regions**: In low-dimensional spaces, local minima are common. In higher-dimensional spaces, localminima are rare, and saddle points are more common.\n",

    "- **Cliﬀs and Exploding Gradients**: On the face of an extremely steep cliﬀ structure, thegradient update step can move the parameters extremely far, usually jumping oﬀthe cliﬀ structure altogether.\n",

    "- **Inexact Gradients**: Most optimization algorithms are designed with the assumption that we haveaccess to the exact gradient or Hessian matrix. In practice, we usually have onlya noisy or even biased estimate of these quantities. Nearly every deep learningalgorithm relies on sampling-based estimates, at least insofar as using a minibatchof training examples to compute the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Poor Correspondence between Local and Global Structure**: Many of the problems we have discussed so far correspond to properties of the loss function at a single point—it can be diﬃcult to make a single step if $J(\\theta)$ is poorly conditioned at the current point $\\theta$, or if $\\theta$ lies on a cliff, or if $\\theta$ is a saddlepoint hiding the opportunity to make progress downhill from the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Theoretical Limits of Optimization**: Some theoretical results showthat there exist problem classes that are intractable, but it can be diﬃcult to tellwhether a particular problem falls into that class. Other results show that ﬁndinga solution for a network of a given size is intractable, but in practice we can ﬁnd asolution easily by using a larger network for which many more parameter settingscorrespond to an acceptable solution."

This is because the SGD gradient estimator introduces a source of noise (the random sampling of $m$ training examples) that does not vanish even when we arriveat a minimum. By comparison, the true gradient of the total cost function becomessmall and then0when we approach and reach a minimum using batch gradient descent, so batch gradient descent can use a ﬁxed learning rate.
