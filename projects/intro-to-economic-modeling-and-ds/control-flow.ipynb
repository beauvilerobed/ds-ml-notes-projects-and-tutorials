    "In economics and finance, **assets** provide a stream of **payoffs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These **assets** can be concrete or abstract: a stock pays dividends over time, a bond pays interest, an apple tree provides apples, a job pays wages, and an education provides possible jobs (which, in turn, pay wages). When deciding the price to pay for an asset or how to choose between different alternatives, we need to take into account that most people would prefer to receive 1 payoff today vs. 1 next year.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reflection on consumer preferences leads to the notion of a **discount rate**. If you are indifferent between receiving \\$1 dollar today and \\$1.10 next year, then the discount rate over the next year is $r=0.10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that an individuals preferences are consistent over time, then we can apply that same discount rate to valuing assets further into the future. For example, we would expect that the consumer would be indifferent between consuming \\$1.00 today and $(1+r)(1+r) = 1.21$ dollars two years from now (i.e. discount twice).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverting this formula, 1 delivered two years from now is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{(1+r)^2}$ today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Net Present Value\n",
    "\n",
    "If an asset pays a stream of payoffs over multiple time periods, then we can use a discount rate to calculate the value to the consumer of a entire sequence of payoffs. Most generally, we enumerate each discrete time period (e.g. year, month, day) by the index $t$ where today is $t=0$ and the asset lives for $T$ periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "List the payoff at each time period as $y_t$, which we will assume, for now, is known in advance. Then if the discount factor is $r\\geq 0$, the consumer \"values\" the payoff $y_t$ delivered at time $t$ as $\\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$ where we note that if $t=0$, the value is just the current payoff $y_0$.\n",

    "# Conditional Statements and Blocks\n",
    "Sometimes, we will only want to execute some piece of code if a certain condition is met. These conditions can be anything. For example, we might add to total sales if the transaction value is positive, but add to total returns if the value is negative. Or, we might want to add up all incurred costs, only if the transaction happened before a certain date. We use **conditionals** to run particular pieces of code when certain criterion are met. Conditionals are closely tied to booleans, so if you don’t remember what those are, go back to the basics notebook for a refresher.\n",
