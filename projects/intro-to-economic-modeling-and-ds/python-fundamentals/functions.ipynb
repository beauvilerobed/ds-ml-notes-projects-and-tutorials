    "**Outcomes**\n",
    "- Economic Production Functions\n",

    "- Functions\n",

    "# Application: Production Functions\n",
    "Production functions are useful when modeling the economics of firms producing goods or the aggregate output in an economy. Though the term “function” is used in a mathematical sense here, we will be making tight connections between the programming of mathematical functions and Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Factors of Production\n",
    "The [factors of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factors_of_production) are the inputs used in the production of some sort of output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some example factors of production include\n",
    "- [Physical capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_capital), e.g. machines, buildings, computers, and power stations.\n",
    "- Labor, e.g. all of the hours of work from different types of employees of a firm.\n",
    "- [Human Capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital), e.g. the knowledge of employees within a firm.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [production function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_function) maps a set of inputs to the output, e.g. the amount of wheat produced by a farm, or widgets produced in a factory. As an example of the notation, we denote the total units of labor and physical capital used in a factory as $L$ and $K$ respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we denote the physical output of the factory as $Y$, then a production function $F$ that transforms labor and capital into output might have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = F(K,L)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example Production Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this lecture, we will use the Cobb-Douglas production function to help us understand how to create Python functions and why they are useful. The Cobb-Douglas production function has appealing statistical properties when brought to data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is displayed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = zK^\\alpha L^{1-\\alpha}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function is parameterized by:\n",
    "- A parameter $\\alpha\\in [0,1]$, called the “output elasticity of capital”.\n",
    "- A value $z$ called the [Total Factor Productivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity) (TFP).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What are (Python) Functions?\n",
    "In this class, we will often talk about `functions`. So what is a function? We like to think of a function as a production line in a manufacturing plant: we pass zero or more things to it, operations take place in a set linear sequence, and zero or more things come out.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use functions for the following purposes:\n",
    "- **Re-usability**: Writing code to do a specific task just once, and reuse the code by calling the function.\n",
    "- **Organization**: Keep the code for distinct operations separated and organized.\n",
    "- **Sharing/collaboration**: Sharing code across multiple projects or sharing pieces of code with collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How to Define (Python) Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic syntax to create our own function is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(inputs):\n",
    "    # step 1\n",
    "    # step 2\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "    return outputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see two new keywords: `def` and `return`.\n",
    "- def is used to tell Python we would like to define a new function.\n",
    "- return is used to tell Python what we would like to return from a function.\n",
    "\n",

    "It also means that although we called the output `answer` inside of the function `mean`, that this variable name was only valid inside of our function. To use the output of the function, we had to give it our own name (`the_mean` in this example). Another point to make here is that the intermediate variables we defined inside `mean` (`total` and `N`) are only defined inside of the `mean` function – we can’t access them from outside. We can verify this by trying to see what the value of `total` is:"
