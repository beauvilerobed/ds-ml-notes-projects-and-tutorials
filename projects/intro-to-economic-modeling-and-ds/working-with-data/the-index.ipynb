    "## Automatic Alignment\n",
    "For all (row, column) combinations that appear in both DataFrames (e.g. rows `[1, 3]` and columns `[Imports, Exports]`), the value of `im_ex_tiny` is equal to `df_tiny.loc[row, col] + im_ex.loc[row, col]`. This happened even though the rows and columns were not in the same order. We refer to this as pandas *aligning* the data for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how awesome this is, think about how to do something similar in Excel:\n",
    "- `df_tiny` and `im_ex` would be in different sheets.\n",
    "- The index and column names would be the first column and row in each sheet.\n",
    "- We would have a third sheet to hold the sum.\n",
    "- For each label in the first row and column of *either* the `df_tiny` sheet or the `im_ex` sheet we would have to do a `IFELSE` to check if the label exists in the other sheet and then a `VLOOKUP` to extract the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, this happens automatically, behind the scenes, and very *quickly*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handling Missing Data\n",
    "For all elements in row 1 or columns `[\"country\", \"year\", \"GovExpend\", \"Consumption\", \"GDP\"]`, the value in `im_ex_tiny` is `NaN`. This is how pandas represents *missing* data. So, when pandas was trying to look up the values in `df_tiny` and `im_ex`, it could only find a value in one DataFrame: the other value was missing. When pandas tries to add a number to something that is missing, it says that the result is missing (spelled `NaN`).\n",
