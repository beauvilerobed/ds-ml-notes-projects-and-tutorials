    "### Probability\n",
    "Before we learn how to use Python to generate randomness, we should make sure that we all agree on some basic concepts of probability. To think about the probability of some event occurring, we must understand what possible events could occur – mathematicians refer to this as the event space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples are\n",
    "- For a coin flip, the coin could either come up heads, tails, or land on its side.\n",
    "- The inches of rain falling in a certain location on a given day could be any real number between 0 and $\\infty$.\n",
    "- The change in an S&P500 stock price could be any real number between - opening price and $\\infty$.\n",
    "- An individual’s employment status tomorrow could either be employed or unemployed.\n",
    "- And the list goes on…\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in some of these cases, the event space can be counted (coin flip and employment status) while in others, the event space cannot be counted (rain and stock prices). We refer to random variables with countable event spaces as discrete random variables and random variables with uncountable event spaces as continuous random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then call certain numbers ‘probabilities’ and associate them with events from the event space.\n",
    "The following is true about probabilities.\n",
    "1. The probability of any event must be greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "1. The probability of all events from the event space must sum (or integrate) to 1.\n",
    "1. If two events cannot occur at same time, then the probability that at least one of them occurs is the sum of the probabilities that each event occurs (known as independence).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating Randomness in Python\n",
    "One of the most basic random numbers is a variable that has equal probability of being any value between 0 and 1. You may have previously learned about this probability distribution as the Uniform(0, 1). Let’s dive into generating some random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below multiple times and see what numbers you get."

    "## Why Do We Need Randomness?\n",
    "As economists and data scientists, we study complex systems. These systems have inherent randomness, but they do not readily reveal their underlying distribution to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where we face this difficulty, we turn to a set of tools known as **Monte Carlo methods**. These methods effectively boil down to repeatedly simulating some event (or events) and looking at the outcome distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool is used to inform decisions in search and rescue missions, election predictions, sports, and even by the Federal Reserve. The reasons that Monte Carlo methods work is a mathematical theorem known as the *Law of Large Numbers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Law of Large Numbers basically says that under relatively general conditions, the distribution of simulated outcomes will mimic the true distribution as the number of simulated events goes to infinity. We already know how the uniform distribution looks, so let’s demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers by approximating the uniform distribution."

    "## Discrete Distributions\n",
    "Sometimes we will encounter variables that can only take one of a few possible values. We refer to this type of random variable as a discrete distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a small business loan company. Imagine that the company’s loan requires a repayment of $\\$25,000$ and must be repaid 1 year after the loan was made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company discounts the future at 5%. Additionally, the loans made are repaid in full with 75% probability, while $\\$12,500$ of loans is repaid with probability 20%, and no repayment with 5% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much would the small business loan company be willing to loan if they’d like to – on average – break even?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can compute this by hand:\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount repaid, on average, is: $0.75(25,000) + 0.2(12,500) + 0.05(0) = 21,250$. Since we’ll receive that amount in one year, we have to discount it: $\\frac{1}{1+0.05} 21,250 \\approx 20238$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now verify by simulating the outcomes of many loans."
